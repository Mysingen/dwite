  * Moved font path handling into fonts.py:get_path() to make it easier
    to handle differently for different environments.
  * Moved loading/saving of Conman configuration data from the backend
    to the main thread. Changed the format slightly as there is no need
    to track more than one backend.
  * Bugfix: Root menu was not redrawn correctly when more than one CM
    present and CM got removed.
  * Offload long running operations in the file system backend onto
    worker threads to stop the CM from becomming unresponsive. The
    threads have .daemon set to make sure they are automatically shut
    down when the program terminates.
  * All use of libFLAC moved into its own process to protect the rest of
    the program from segmentation faults in or below the ctypes integration.
  * Bugfix: Threads can only have ASCII characters in their names
  * Implemented chunking of RPC results. Used it on Ls and Search.
  * Fixed the callback system for messages so that the callback is
    always executed by the thread that registered it.
  * Reworked the rendering system to get rid of redundant rendering
    and to remove some structural limitations that were increasingly
    hard to work with.
  * Highlight characters from left to right in the list of search term
    suggestions. The number of characters is equal to the number of NUM*
    entered on the remote.
