Installation on Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu 10.04 TLS
-----------------------------------------------------
* Become +root+ or some other user with privileges to run +apt-get+.
* Run +apt-get install python python-imaging python-mutagen libmagic1
  libflac8 sqlite3+
Now you should be able to run Dwite and the Conman:
----
cd <the Dwite sources directory>
./dwite &
./conman
----

Installation On OS X 10.5
-------------------------

Python
~~~~~~
* Go to +http://python.org/download/releases/+ and download a 2.7 release.
* Follow regular installation procedures for OS X programs.

PIL
~~~
Dwite requires that PIL is built with support for FreeType2. PIL itself requires
GCC to build.

* GCC: Follow instructions given here: +http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4360110/
installing-gcc-to-mac-os-x-leopard-without-installing-xcode+
* FreeType2: Follow instructions given here: +http://groups.google.com/group/
python-virtualenv/browse_thread/thread/d42f8fd2c52e88b7+

Now you should be able to install PIL:

* Go to http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ and download the latest "Source
  Kit (all platforms)".
* Unpack the download and enter the resulting directory from a Terminal:
----
cd <your path to unpacked directory>
python2.7 setup.py build
----

* Pay attention to the SETUP SUMMARY. It should include a line that reads

----
--- FREETYPE2 support available
----

* To install, run
----
sudo python2.7 setup.py install
----

Mutagen
~~~~~~~
* Go to +http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/downloads/list+ and download the
  latest release. E.g. mutagen-1.20.tar.gz.
* Unpack the downloaded package.
* Open a terminal and enter the directory +mutagen-x.xx+ (where x.xx is the
  version you downloaded).
* Run the command
----
sudo python2.7 setup.py install
----

Python-Magic
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python-Magic requires libmagic which is part of the +file+ utility.

* Download +http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/file/
  file_5.04.orig.tar.gz+, unpack it and follow the instructions in the
  included +INSTALL+ file.
* go to +http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic/+ and download the latest
  source release of Python-Magic.
* Unpack the Python-Magic tarball, enter it from a Terminal and run:
----
sudo python2.7 setup.py install
----

libFLAC
~~~~~~~
This appears to be a standard install on OS X 10.5. You shouldn't have to do
anything, but if you do:

* Go to +http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html+, download one of the
  installers for OS X and run it. Hopefully it will work. Otherwise try another
  one.

SQLite3
~~~~~~~
This appears to be a standard install on OS X 10.5. You shouldn't have to do
anything.
